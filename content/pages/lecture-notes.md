Students are assigned {{% resource_link 35165b3e-7d2b-0ab9-1660-f01179fffd3d "readings" %}} in these lecture notes each week. The present lecture notes arose from a representation theory course given by Prof. Etingof in March 2004 within the framework of the {{% resource_link "f42c905e-bff0-4d3a-8de8-0f2cb16a4624" "Clay Mathematics Institute Research Academy" %}} for high school students. The students in that course — Oleg Golberg, Sebastian Hensel, Tiankai Liu, Alex Schwendner, Elena Yudovina, and Dmitry Vaintrob — co-authored the lecture notes which are published here with their permission.

The book _Introduction to Representation Theory_ based on these notes was published by the American Mathematical Society in 2016. A {{% resource_link "419a14cc-e34e-43dd-a5c5-c800bd251577" "complete file of the book (PDF - 1.1MB)" %}} is on Prof. Etingof's webpage. \[Please note: This file cannot be posted on any website not belonging to the authors.\]
